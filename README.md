# LunchMoney MCP Server (Enhanced Fork)

An enhanced fork of the [original LunchMoney MCP server](https://github.com/akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp) with search capabilities and token optimization.

## Enhancements in This Fork

### Pagination
The API's `limit` and `offset` parameters are passed through directly. Response includes `count`, `has_more`, and the pagination params you specified.

> **Note:** The API had a regression where these params were ignored ([issue #83](https://github.com/lunch-money/developers/issues/83)), which was fixed in Jan 2026.

### Token Optimization
- **`include_plaid_metadata`** parameter (default: `false`) - Strip verbose Plaid metadata from responses to reduce token usage by ~40-60%
- Set to `true` when you need original transaction names, merchant info, or Plaid category suggestions for corrections

### New Search Tool
- **`search_transactions`** - Search by payee name, notes, or original_name with case-insensitive matching
- Performs local filtering on API results
- Use narrow date ranges for best performance

## Usage

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Desktop Extension Tool (DXT) - Recommended

The easiest way to install this server is as a Desktop Extension Tool in Claude Desktop:

1. Download the latest `.dxt` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp/releases)
2. Open Claude Desktop and go to Extensions
3. Click "Install Extension" and select the downloaded `.dxt` file
4. Enter your LunchMoney API token when prompted (get it from [LunchMoney Developer Settings](https://my.lunchmoney.app/developers))
5. The LunchMoney tools will be immediately available

#### Option 2: Manual MCP Configuration

To use this MCP server with any MCP-compatible client (such as Claude Desktop), you need to add it to the client's configuration.

#### Configuration

The server can be configured in your MCP client's configuration file. The exact location and format may vary by client, but typically follows this pattern:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "lunchmoney": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp"],
            "env": {
                "LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `"your-api-token-here"` with your actual LunchMoney API token from [LunchMoney Developer Settings](https://my.lunchmoney.app/developers).

#### Common MCP Client Configuration Locations

Different MCP clients store their configuration in different locations:

-   **Claude Desktop**:

    -   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    -   Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    -   Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

-   **Other MCP Clients**: Check your client's documentation for the configuration file location.

#### Setup Steps

1. Locate your MCP client's configuration file (create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Add the LunchMoney server configuration to the `mcpServers` section.
3. Save the file and restart your MCP client.
4. The LunchMoney tools should now be available in your client.

#### Requirements

-   Node.js 16+ installed on your system
-   `npx` available in your system PATH
-   Valid LunchMoney API token with appropriate permissions

### As a standalone MCP server

```bash
# Run with npx
LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN="your-api-token" npx @akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp
```
